## 💡 Why Continuity?

AI coding assistants are powerful but stateless. Every new session starts from zero. **Continuity solves this.**

Instead of explaining your architecture every time, Continuity maintains:
- ✅ Past decisions and rationale
- ✅ Code structure and documentation
- ✅ Protected files (no more AI editing .env)
- ✅ Project-specific context that persists

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **All data stays local** - decisions stored in your project's `.continuity/` folder
- **No telemetry** - your code and decisions never leave your machine
- **Git-friendly** - works seamlessly with version control

## 📦 Pricing

- **Free Tier**: Core decision logging, manual sync, basic search
- **Pro Tier**: Semantic search, knowledge graphs, AI auto-logging
